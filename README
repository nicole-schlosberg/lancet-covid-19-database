# Lancet Data Extractions

## Data

The full database can be found in the `/data` folder.

### countries.csv

This file lists the country IDs used in the database and indicator files.
The IDs used are the ISO 3166 3-letter codes.

## Testing

To test the extractions, run `pytest`. It invokes tests defined in the
`/tests` folder.

## Caveats

Only countries are retained. Diamond Princess, for example, is not.
